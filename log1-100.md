### Day 2: Fri, 13th Sep

• [Advanced CSS & Sass](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/)

• Your own stylesheet should always be included last when using third party stylesheets. This way yours always has priority.

• Setting the default font size to a pixel value will override the users ability to increase the font size from the browser. Not good practice for people with poor eyesight. User-agent font sizes are usually 16px. Taking a percent value (62.5% | 10px) will scale with the users customizations. 

• Using rem values are 1000 times better than pixel values. Makes scaling so much easier.

• Sass has a `background-color: darken(color, percent)` & `lighten()` value

• When making one of those cards that have a picture with text good to use semantic html such as `<figure` and `<figcaption` 

• `.class { filter: blur(3px) brightness(80%) }` can alter image nicely.

• `<video autoplay muted loop> <source src="../..." type="video/webm">` useful to know and can have multiple video srcs incase browser doesn't support the first.
