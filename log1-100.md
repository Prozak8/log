### Day 2: Fri, 13th Sep

• [Advanced CSS & Sass](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/)

• Your own stylesheet should always be included last when using third party stylesheets. This way yours always has priority.

• Setting the default font size to a pixel value will override the users ability to increase the font size from the browser. Not good practice for people with poor eyesight. User-agent font sizes are usually 16px. Taking a percent value (62.5% | 10px) will scale with the users customizations. 

• Using rem values are 1000 times better than pixel values. Makes scaling so much easier.

• Sass has a `background-color: darken(color, percent)` & `lighten()` value

• [Advanced CSS & Sass](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/)

• Using the `&:not()` pseudo class selected all elements excepte the one specified. Example:
```
.row
  max-width: 1140px
  margin: 0 auto
  &:not(:last-child)
    margin-bottom: 2rem
```
• You can use an array syntax in css. `[class^="col-"]` means all classes that start with col-, class*= means all classes that contain col- and $ which is all classes that end with col-.
