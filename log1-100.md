### Day 1: Thurs, 12th Sep, 2019

• [Advanced CSS & Sass](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/)

• When using absolute positioning to center, use `transform: scale (x, y)` for perfect centerring.

• Animations and keyframes.

• `btn:link, btn:visited` good practive to styling buttons.

• `animation-fill-mode: backwards` will make it so that you can hide the element until the animation begins.

• CMD + D on highlighted text selected the next identical text.

#### Questions:

###### • Best practice to use inline-blocks and normal blocks?

### Day 2: Fri, 13th Sep

• [Advanced CSS & Sass](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/)

• Your own stylesheet should always be included last when using third party stylesheets. This way yours always has priority.

• Setting the default font size to a pixel value will override the users ability to increase the font size from the browser. Not good practice for people with poor eyesight. User-agent font sizes are usually 16px. Taking a percent value (62.5% | 10px) will scale with the users customizations. 

• Using rem values are 1000 times better than pixel values. Makes scaling so much easier.

• Sass has a `background-color: darken(color, percent)` & `lighten()` value

### Day 3: Mon, 16th Sep

• [Advanced CSS & Sass](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/)

• Using the `&:not()` pseudo class selected all elements excepte the one specified. Example:
```
.row
  max-width: 1140px
  margin: 0 auto
  &:not(:last-child)
    margin-bottom: 2rem
```
• You can use an array syntax in css. `[class^="col-"]` means all classes that start with col-, class*= means all classes that contain col- and $ which is all classes that end with col-.

### Day 4: Fri, 27th Sep, 2019

• [Advanced CSS & Sass](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/)

• When styling unordered lists best just to have it in a parent div then use html elements to style.

• `box-decoration-break: clone` will act like a `<br>` and treat each line of text as a new element, thus applying the same styles.

----
### Day 5: Mon, 30th Sep, 2019

• [Advanced CSS & Sass](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/)

• When making one of those cards that have a picture with text good to use semantic html such as `<figure` and `<figcaption` 

• `.class { filter: blur(3px) brightness(80%) }` can alter image nicely.

• `<video autoplay muted loop> <source src="../..." type="video/webm">` useful to know and can have multiple video srcs incase browser doesn't support the first. 

----
### Day 6: Tue, 1st Oct, 2019

• [Advanced CSS & Sass](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/)

• `column-count: 2` divides blocks of text. Could be good for large bodies of text on bigger screens.

• hamburger menu can be created with one span and a ::before & ::after. 

• Checkbox hack for displaying navigation. Can position the associated `<label>` element wherever and that will act as the button. Then using the css pseudo :checked can you target the child or sibling elements.

----
### Day 7: Tue, 1st Oct, 2019

• [Angular.js](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_05)

• In Angular you can use `<input ng-model="$ctrl.query">` and then loop over data using `ng-repeat="item in $ctrl.items | filter:$ctrl.query"`. Quite a neat trick.

### Day 8: Fri, 4th Oct, 2019

• [Advanced CSS & Sass](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/)

```
<picture>
  <source srcset="Low res img src".png 1x, "High res img src".png 2x" media="(max-width: 600px)">
    <img srcset="img/logo-green-1x.png 1x, img/logo-green-2x.png 2x"/>
</picture>
```
- Above code lets you use different images depending on both resolution and media queries, something I would normally do with a plugin. It requires the `<picture>` to be the parent. Source changes the image based on screen width, then the `<img>` has two arguments based on the DPI.
